    "# Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It allows you to create a new class (derived or child class) based on an existing class (base or parent class). In Python, you can achieve inheritance easily, and it's a powerful mechanism for code reuse and building more specialized classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Base Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we delve into inheritance, let's create a base class to work with. A base class is the class from which another class inherits properties and behaviors. We'll call it `Animal` and give it some basic attributes and methods:"
