    "Python is an interpreted programming language, which means that if you want to run Python code, you need to install Python. Unlike compiled languages, Python doesn't need a compiler to translate your code into machine language. Instead, it uses an interpreter. This means that you can write a line of code, and then execute it immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, there are two methods to run Python code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write your code in a file, save it, then run it from the command line.\n",
    "2. Write your code in the Python REPL, which is the Python command line interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running Python Code\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running Python Code in a File\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you wrote some code in a file named `script.py` and you want to run the code. You can do this by opening the command line, ***navigating to the directory where the file is located***, and running the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python script.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running Python Code in the REPL\n",
    "\n",
    "The REPL stands for Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop and it is the Python command line interface. This interface is useful for testing short amounts of code because you can write code and see the results immediately without having to write a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the REPL, open the command line and type the following:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see something like this:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Python 3.8.5 (default, Jan 27 2021, 15:41:15)\n",
    "[GCC 9.3.0] on linux\n",
    "Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more\n",
    "information.\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can write any Python code and see the results immediately. For example, if you type `print(\"Hello, World!\")`, you should see the following:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    ">>> print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "Hello, World!\n",
    ">>>\n",

    "## Installing a Text Editor\n",
    "\n",
    "Realistically, you do not require any text editor aside from the default text editor your operating system provides, however I highly recommend using recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for writing Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mainly since it's free, open-source, and has a lot of great features that make it easy to write code. It's also one of the most popular text editors for writing code, and it's used by many professional developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "As most \"Getting Started\" guides for Python would recommend some kind of IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), I personally don't recommend using an IDE for writing Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mainly because IDEs are often bloated with features that you don't need, they can be confusing to use, and they aren't commonly used by professional developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Visual Studio Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to the [Visual Studio Code downloads page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).\n",
    "2. Click the **\"Download for Windows\"** button.\n",
    "3. Open the downloaded file and follow the installation instructions.\n",
    "4. Once the installation is complete, you should be able to open **Visual Studio Code** from the start menu.\n",
    "5. Alternatively, you can open the command line and type `code` to open it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing the Python Extension\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open **Visual Studio Code**.\n",
    "2. Click the **\"Extensions\"** icon in the left sidebar.\n",
    "3. Search for the following extensions and click install:\n",
    "   1. **Python** by Microsoft\n",
    "   2. **Pylance** by Microsoft\n",
    "   3. **Remote - SSH** by Microsoft\n",
    "   4. **indent-rainbow** by oderwat\n",
    "4. Once installed, you should see a **\"Reload Required\"** button, click it.\n",
    "   - If not, then you should be all set!\n",
    "5. Now you should be able to write and run Python code in **Visual Studio Code**.\n",
    "6. If you want to open a file in **Visual Studio Code**, there a few ways to do it:\n",
    "   1. From **Visual Studio Code**, click **\"File\"** > **\"Open File...\"** and select the file you want to open.\n",
    "   2. Alternatively, from the command-line you can type `code FILENAME` to open it.\n",
    "      - Replace `FILENAME` with the name of the file you want to open.\n",
    "7. If you want to open the directory where a file is located, you can do the following:\n",
    "   1. From **Visual Studio Code**, click **\"File\"** > **\"Open Folder...\"** and select the directory you want to open.\n",
    "   2. Alternatively, from the command-line you can type `code .` to open the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing and Running Python Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open **Visual Studio Code**.\n",
    "2. Click **\"File\"** > **\"Open Folder...\"** and select the directory you want to open.\n",
