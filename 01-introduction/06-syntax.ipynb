    "# Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's syntax is known for its simplicity and readability. Understanding Python's syntax is essential for writing clean and error-free code. In this section, we'll cover the fundamental aspects of Python syntax, including code structure, indentation, whitespace, and code blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Python code is organized into logical units, which can include statements, functions, and classes. The code structure defines how your Python program is organized and executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Python programs are composed of statements. A statement is a single line of code that performs a specific action. For example, the following are Python statements:"
