    "# If Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements are a fundamental part of programming, allowing you to make decisions in your code based on specific conditions. In Python, you can use `if`, `if-else`, and `if-elif-else` statements to control the flow of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `if` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest conditional statement is the `if` statement. It allows you to execute a block of code if a certain condition is met. If the condition is `True`, the code block is executed. If the condition is `False`, the code block is skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # Code to execute if the condition is True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the below, the code inside the `if` block is executed because the `age` variable is greater than or equal to 18."

    "## The `if-else` Statement\n",

    "The `if-else` statement allows you to specify two code blocks: one to execute if the condition is `True`, and another to execute if the condition is `False`.\n",
    "\n",
