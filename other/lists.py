"""List type."""

# Lists are very similar to arrays. They can contain any type of variable, and they can contain
# as many variables as you wish. Lists can also be iterated over in a very simple manner.
# Here is an example of how to build a list.
squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

isinstance(squares, list)

# Like strings (and all other built-in sequence type), lists can be
# indexed and sliced:
squares[0] == 1  # indexing returns the item
squares[-1] == 25
squares[-3:] == [9, 16, 25]  # slicing returns a new list

# All slice operations return a new list containing the requested elements.
# This means that the following slice returns a new (shallow) copy of
# the list:
squares[:] == [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# Lists also support operations like concatenation:
squares + [36, 49, 64, 81, 100] == [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

# Unlike strings, which are immutable, lists are a mutable type, i.e. it
# is possible to change their content:
cubes = [1, 8, 27, 65, 125]  # something's wrong here, the cube of 4 is 64!
cubes[3] = 64  # replace the wrong value
cubes == [1, 8, 27, 64, 125]

# You can also add new items at the end of the list, by using
# the append() method
cubes.append(216)  # add the cube of 6
cubes.append(7 ** 3)  # and the cube of 7
cubes == [1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343]

# Assignment to slices is also possible, and this can even change the size
# of the list or clear it entirely:
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']
letters[2:5] = ['C', 'D', 'E']  # replace some values
letters == ['a', 'b', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'f', 'g']
letters[2:5] = []  # now remove them
letters == ['a', 'b', 'f', 'g']
# clear the list by replacing all the elements with an empty list
letters[:] = []
letters == []

# The built-in function len() also applies to lists
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
len(letters) == 4

# It is possible to nest lists (create lists containing other lists),
# for example:
list_of_chars = ['a', 'b', 'c']
list_of_numbers = [1, 2, 3]
mixed_list = [list_of_chars, list_of_numbers]
mixed_list == [['a', 'b', 'c'], [1, 2, 3]]
mixed_list[0] == ['a', 'b', 'c']
mixed_list[0][1] == 'b'

"""The del statement

There is a way to remove an item from a list given its index instead of its value: the del
statement. This differs from the pop() method which returns a value. The del statement can also
be used to remove slices from a list or clear the entire list (which we did earlier by
assignment of an empty list to the slice).

"""List Comprehensions.

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Common applications are to make new
lists where each element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another
sequence or iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain
condition.

A list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause,
then zero or more for or if clauses. The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating
the expression in the context of the for and if clauses which follow it.
