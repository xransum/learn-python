# Syntax

Python's syntax is known for its simplicity and readability. Understanding Python's syntax is essential for writing clean and error-free code. In this section, we'll cover the fundamental aspects of Python syntax, including code structure, indentation, whitespace, and code blocks.

## Code Structure

Python code is organized into logical units, which can include statements, functions, and classes. The code structure defines how your Python program is organized and executed.

### Statements

Python programs are composed of statements. A statement is a single line of code that performs a specific action. For example, the following are Python statements:


```python
print("Hello, world!")
x = 10
```

    Hello, world!
    

### Indentation

Python uses indentation to define code blocks. Unlike other programming languages that use braces or keywords like "end," Python relies on consistent indentation to group statements.

For example, in the following Python code, the indented block is part of the `if` statement:


```python
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
```

    x is greater than 5
    

## Whitespace

Python is sensitive to whitespace, which means that spaces and tabs are used for indentation and alignment. You should use spaces consistently to maintain code readability.

Here's an example of good practice:


```python
x = 5
y = 10
```

The below code illustrates what happens when mixing spaces and tabs:


```python
x = 5
    y = 10  # This line will cause an error.
```


      Cell In[4], line 2
        y = 10  # This will result in an error
        ^
    IndentationError: unexpected indent
    


## Code Blocks

Python uses colons (:) to indicate the start of code blocks, such as loops and functions. The code within the block is indented.


```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)  # This code block is indented
```

    0
    1
    2
    3
    4
    

The use of indentation and colons ensures that your Python code is easy to understand and free from ambiguities.

## Conclusion

Mastering Python's syntax is the first step to becoming a proficient Python programmer. By understanding code structure, indentation, whitespace, and code blocks, you'll be well on your way to writing clean and maintainable Python code.
